# predictingSpotifyHits

This is a dataset consisting of features for tracks fetched using Spotify's Web API. The tracks are labeled '1' or '0' ('Hit' or 'Flop') depending on some criteria of the author.
This dataset can be used to make a classification model that predicts whether a track would be a 'Hit' or not.
